-- Base Protocol Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Base class of requests, responses, and events.
--(Title: Base Protocol)
---@class dap.ProtocolMessage
---@field seq integer Sequence number of the message (also known as message ID). The `seq` for the **first** message sent by a client or debug adapter is `1`, and for each subsequent message is `1` greater than the previous message sent by that actor. `seq` can be used to order requests, responses, and events, and to associate requests with their corresponding responses. For protocol messages of type `request` the sequence number can be used to **cancel** the request.
---@field type dap.ProtocolMessageType Message type.

--- A client or debug adapter initiated request.
---@class dap.Request : dap.ProtocolMessage
---@field type "request" # Message type, overridden from `dap.ProtocolMessage`.
---@field command string The command to execute.
---@field arguments? dap.JsonValue Object containing arguments for the command. (Specific requests will use concrete argument types)

--- A debug adapter initiated event.
---@class dap.Event : dap.ProtocolMessage
---@field type "event" # Message type, overridden from `dap.ProtocolMessage`.
---@field event string Type of event.
---@field body? dap.JsonValue Event-specific information. (Specific events will use concrete body types)

--- Response for a request.
---@class dap.Response : dap.ProtocolMessage
---@field type "response" # Message type, overridden from `dap.ProtocolMessage`.
---@field request_seq integer Sequence number of the corresponding request.
---@field success boolean Outcome of the request.<br>If `true`, the request was successful and the `body` attribute *may* contain the result of the request.<br>If the value is `false`, the attribute `message` contains the error in short form and the `body` *may* contain additional information (see `dap.ErrorResponse.body.error`).
---@field command string The command requested.
---@field message? dap.ResponseMessageStatusEnum Contains the raw error in short form if `success` is `false`.<br>This raw error *might* be interpreted by the client and is **not** shown in the UI.<br>Some predefined values exist.
---@field body? dap.JsonValue Contains request result if `success` is `true` and error details if `success` is `false`. (Specific responses will use concrete body types)

--- A structured message object. Used to return errors from requests.
---@class dap.Message
---@field id integer Unique (within a debug adapter implementation) identifier for the message. The purpose of these error IDs is to help extension authors that have the requirement that every user-visible error message needs a corresponding error number, so that users or customer support can find information about the specific error more easily.
---@field format string A format string for the message. Embedded variables have the form `{name}`.<br>If a variable name starts with an underscore character (`_`), the variable does **not** contain user data (PII) and can be safely used for telemetry purposes.
---@field variables? table<string, string> An object used as a dictionary for looking up the variables in the `format` string.<br>All dictionary values **must be strings**.
---@field sendTelemetry? boolean If `true`, send to telemetry.
---@field showUser? boolean If `true`, show to user.
---@field url? string A URL where additional information about this message can be found.
---@field urlLabel? string A label that is presented to the user as the UI for opening the `url`.

---@class dap.ErrorResponseBody
---@field error? dap.Message A structured error message.

--- On error (whenever `success` is `false`), the `body` can provide more details.
---@class dap.ErrorResponse : dap.Response
---@field body dap.ErrorResponseBody # Overrides/specifies the `body` from `dap.Response`.

---@class dap.InitializeResponse : dap.Response
---@field body? dap.Capabilities # The capabilities of this debug adapter.

--- This event indicates that the debug adapter is **ready to accept configuration requests** (e.g., `setBreakpoints`, `setExceptionBreakpoints`).
--- A debug adapter is expected to send this event when it is ready to accept configuration requests (but **not before** the `initialize` request has finished).
--- The sequence of events/requests is as follows:
--- - Adapter sends `initialized` event (after the `initialize` request has returned).
--- - Client sends zero or more `setBreakpoints` requests.
--- - Client sends one `setFunctionBreakpoints` request (if corresponding capability `supportsFunctionBreakpoints` is `true`).
--- - Client sends a `setExceptionBreakpoints` request if one or more `exceptionBreakpointFilters` have been defined (or if `supportsConfigurationDoneRequest` is **not** `true`).
--- - Client sends other future configuration requests.
--- - Client sends one `configurationDone` request to indicate the end of the configuration.
--- (Title: Events)
---@class dap.InitializedEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "initialized" # Type of event.
---@field body? any # No body defined in schema for InitializedEvent, but Event base class allows it.

--- Arguments for `configurationDone` request.
---@class dap.ConfigurationDoneArguments -- This class has no properties defined in the schema.

--- This request indicates that the client has **finished initialization** of the debug adapter.
--- So it is the *last request* in the sequence of configuration requests (which was started by the `initialized` event).
--- Clients should **only** call this request if the corresponding capability `supportsConfigurationDoneRequest` is `true`.
---@class dap.ConfigurationDoneRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "configurationDone" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments? dap.ConfigurationDoneArguments # Arguments for `configurationDone` request.

--- Response to `configurationDone` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.ConfigurationDoneResponse : dap.Response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Launching and Attaching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Arguments for `launch` request. Additional attributes are implementation specific.
---@class dap.LaunchRequestArguments
---@field noDebug? boolean If `true`, the `launch` request should launch the program **without enabling debugging**.
---@field __restart? dap.JsonValue Arbitrary data from the previous, *restarted* session.<br>The data is sent as the `restart` attribute of the `terminated` event.<br>The client should leave the data *intact*.
---@field [string] any # Allows other properties, implementation specific.

--- This `launch` request is sent from the client to the debug adapter to **start the debuggee** with or without debugging (if `noDebug` is `true`).
--- Since launching is debugger/runtime specific, the arguments for this request are **not part of this specification**.
---@class dap.LaunchRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "launch" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments dap.LaunchRequestArguments # Arguments for `launch` request.

--- Response to `launch` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.LaunchResponse : dap.Response

--- Arguments for `attach` request. Additional attributes are implementation specific.
---@class dap.AttachRequestArguments
---@field __restart? dap.JsonValue Arbitrary data from the previous, *restarted* session.<br>The data is sent as the `restart` attribute of the `terminated` event.<br>The client should leave the data *intact*.
---@field [string] any # Allows other properties, implementation specific.

--- The `attach` request is sent from the client to the debug adapter to **attach to a debuggee that is already running**.
--- Since attaching is debugger/runtime specific, the arguments for this request are **not part of this specification**.
---@class dap.AttachRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "attach" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments dap.AttachRequestArguments # Arguments for `attach` request.

--- Response to `attach` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.AttachResponse : dap.Response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Session Lifecycle (Restart, Disconnect, Terminate)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Arguments for `restart` request.
---@class dap.RestartArguments
---@field arguments? dap.LaunchRequestArguments|dap.AttachRequestArguments The latest version of the `launch` or `attach` configuration.

--- **Restarts a debug session**. Clients should **only** call this request if the corresponding capability `supportsRestartRequest` is `true`.
--- If the capability is missing or has the value `false`, a typical client *emulates* `restart` by terminating the debug adapter first and then launching it anew.
---@class dap.RestartRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "restart" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments? dap.RestartArguments # Arguments for `restart` request.

--- Response to `restart` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.RestartResponse : dap.Response

--- Arguments for `disconnect` request.
---@class dap.DisconnectArguments
---@field restart? boolean A value of `true` indicates that this `disconnect` request is part of a *restart sequence*.
---@field terminateDebuggee? boolean Indicates whether the debuggee should be **terminated** when the debugger is disconnected.<br>If unspecified, the debug adapter is free to do whatever it thinks is best.<br>The attribute is **only honored** by a debug adapter if the corresponding capability `supportTerminateDebuggee` is `true`.
---@field suspendDebuggee? boolean Indicates whether the debuggee should stay **suspended** when the debugger is disconnected.<br>If unspecified, the debuggee should resume execution.<br>The attribute is **only honored** by a debug adapter if the corresponding capability `supportSuspendDebuggee` is `true`.

--- The `disconnect` request asks the debug adapter to **disconnect from the debuggee** (thus ending the debug session) and then to **shut down itself** (the debug adapter).
--- In addition, the debug adapter **must terminate the debuggee** if it was started with the `launch` request. If an `attach` request was used to connect to the debuggee, then the debug adapter **must not** terminate the debuggee.
--- This implicit behavior of when to terminate the debuggee can be overridden with the `terminateDebuggee` argument (which is **only** supported by a debug adapter if the corresponding capability `supportTerminateDebuggee` is `true`).
---@class dap.DisconnectRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "disconnect" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments? dap.DisconnectArguments # Arguments for `disconnect` request.

--- Response to `disconnect` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.DisconnectResponse : dap.Response

--- Arguments for `terminate` request.
---@class dap.TerminateArguments
---@field restart? boolean A value of `true` indicates that this `terminate` request is part of a *restart sequence*.

--- The `terminate` request is sent from the client to the debug adapter in order to **shut down the debuggee gracefully**. Clients should **only** call this request if the capability `supportsTerminateRequest` is `true`.
--- Typically, a debug adapter implements `terminate` by sending a software signal which the debuggee intercepts in order to clean things up properly before terminating itself.
--- **Please note** that this request does **not directly affect** the state of the debug session: if the debuggee decides to *veto* the graceful shutdown for any reason by not terminating itself, then the debug session just *continues*.
--- Clients can surface the `terminate` request as an explicit command or they can integrate it into a two-stage `Stop` command that first sends `terminate` to request a graceful shutdown, and if that fails, uses `disconnect` for a forceful shutdown.
---@class dap.TerminateRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "terminate" # The command to execute.
---@field arguments? dap.TerminateArguments # Arguments for `terminate` request.

--- Response to `terminate` request. This is just an **acknowledgement**, so no `body` field is required.
---@class dap.TerminateResponse : dap.Response

---@class dap.TerminatedEventBody
---@field restart? dap.JsonValue A debug adapter *may* set `restart` to `true` (or to an arbitrary object) to request that the client **restarts the session**.<br>The value is **not interpreted** by the client and passed *unmodified* as an attribute `__restart` to the `launch` and `attach` requests.

--- The event indicates that debugging of the debuggee has **terminated**. This does **not** mean that the debuggee itself has exited.
---@class dap.TerminatedEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "terminated" # Type of event.
---@field body? dap.TerminatedEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.ExitedEventBody
---@field exitCode integer The exit code returned from the debuggee.

--- The event indicates that the debuggee has **exited** and returns its exit code.
---@class dap.ExitedEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "exited" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.ExitedEventBody # Event-specific information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Cancel Request
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Arguments for `cancel` request.
---@class dap.CancelArguments
---@field requestId? integer The ID (attribute `seq`) of the request to cancel. If missing, **no request is cancelled**.<br>Both a `requestId` and a `progressId` can be specified in one request.
---@field progressId? string The ID (attribute `progressId`) of the progress to cancel. If missing, **no progress is cancelled**.<br>Both a `requestId` and a `progressId` can be specified in one request.

--- The `cancel` request is used by the client in **two** situations:
--- - To indicate that it is **no longer interested** in the result produced by a specific request issued earlier.
--- - To **cancel a progress sequence**.
--- Clients should **only** call this request if the corresponding capability `supportsCancelRequest` is `true`.
--- This request has a *hint* characteristic: a debug adapter can **only** be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring this request, but there are **no guarantees**.
--- The `cancel` request *may* return an error if it could not cancel an operation, but a client should **refrain** from presenting this error to end users.
--- The request that got cancelled **still needs to send a response back**. This can either be a normal result (`success` attribute `true`) or an error response (`success` attribute `false` and the `message` set to `"cancelled"`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---@class dap.OutputEventBody
---@field output string The output to report.<br><br>ANSI escape sequences may be used to influence text color and styling if `supportsANSIStyling` is present in both the adapter's `Capabilities` and the client's `InitializeRequestArguments`. A client may strip any unrecognized ANSI sequences.<br><br>If the `supportsANSIStyling` capabilities are not both true, then the client should display the output literally.
---@field category? dap.OutputEventCategoryEnum The output category. If not specified or if the category is not understood by the client, `console` is assumed.
---@field group? dap.OutputEventGroupEnum Support for keeping an output log organized by grouping related messages.
---@field variablesReference? integer If an attribute `variablesReference` exists and its value is > 0, the output contains objects which can be retrieved by passing `variablesReference` to the `variables` request as long as execution remains suspended. See 'Lifetime of Object References' in the Overview section for details.
---@field source? dap.Source The source location where the output was produced.
---@field line? integer The source location's line where the output was produced.
---@field column? integer The position in `line` where the output was produced. It is measured in UTF-16 code units and the client capability `columnsStartAt1` determines whether it is 0- or 1-based.
---@field data? dap.JsonValue Additional data to report. For the `telemetry` category the data is sent to telemetry, for the other categories the data is shown in JSON format.
---@field locationReference? integer A reference that allows the client to request the location where the new value is declared. For example, if the logged value is function pointer, the adapter may be able to look up the function's location. This should be present only if the adapter is likely to be able to resolve the location.<br><br>This reference shares the same lifetime as the `variablesReference`. See 'Lifetime of Object References' in the Overview section for details.

--- The event indicates that the target has produced some output.
---@class dap.OutputEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "output" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.OutputEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.ProcessEventBody
---@field name string The *logical name* of the process. This is usually the full path to the process's executable file (e.g., `/home/example/myproj/program.js`).
---@field systemProcessId? integer The process ID of the debugged process, as assigned by the operating system. This property should be **omitted** for logical processes that do not map to operating system processes on the machine.
---@field isLocalProcess? boolean If `true`, the process is running on the **same computer** as the debug adapter.
---@field startMethod? dap.ProcessEventStartMethodEnum Describes *how* the debug engine started debugging this process.
---@field pointerSize? integer The size of a pointer or address for this process, in bits. This value *may* be used by clients when formatting addresses for display.

--- The event indicates that the debugger has begun debugging a **new process**. Either one that it has launched or one that it has attached to.
---@class dap.ProcessEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "process" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.ProcessEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.CapabilitiesEventBody
---@field capabilities dap.Capabilities The set of *updated* capabilities.

--- The event indicates that **one or more capabilities have changed**.
--- Since the capabilities are dependent on the client and its UI, it *might not be possible* to change them at random times (or too late).
--- Consequently, this event has a *hint* characteristic: a client can **only** be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring individual capabilities, but there are **no guarantees**.
--- **Only changed** capabilities need to be included; all other capabilities keep their values.
---@class dap.CapabilitiesEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "capabilities" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.CapabilitiesEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.InvalidatedEventBody
---@field areas? dap.InvalidatedAreas[] Set of logical areas that got invalidated. This property has a *hint* characteristic: a client can **only** be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring the areas, but there are **no guarantees**. If this property is missing, empty, or if values are not understood, the client should assume a single value `"all"`.
---@field threadId? integer If specified, the client **only** needs to refetch data related to this thread.
---@field stackFrameId? integer If specified, the client **only** needs to refetch data related to this stack frame (and the `threadId` is ignored).

--- This event signals that some state in the debug adapter has changed and requires that the client needs to **re-render the data snapshot** previously requested.
--- Debug adapters do **not have to** emit this event for runtime changes like `stopped` or `thread` events because in that case, the client refetches the new state anyway. But the event *can be used*, for example, to refresh the UI after rendering formatting has changed in the debug adapter.
--- This event should **only** be sent if the corresponding capability `supportsInvalidatedEvent` is `true`.
---@class dap.InvalidatedEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "invalidated" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.InvalidatedEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.MemoryEventBody
---@field memoryReference string Memory reference of a memory range that has been updated.
---@field offset integer Starting offset in bytes where memory has been updated. Can be negative.
---@field count integer Number of bytes updated.

--- This event indicates that some **memory range has been updated**. It should **only** be sent if the corresponding capability `supportsMemoryEvent` is `true`.
--- Clients typically react to the event by re-issuing a `readMemory` request if they show the memory identified by the `memoryReference` and if the updated memory range overlaps the displayed range. Clients should **not make assumptions** about how individual memory references relate to each other, so they should not assume that they are part of a single continuous address range and might overlap.
--- Debug adapters can use this event to indicate that the contents of a memory range has changed due to some other request like `setVariable` or `setExpression`. Debug adapters are **not expected** to emit this event for each and every memory change of a running program, because that information is typically not available from debuggers and it would flood clients with too many events.
---@class dap.MemoryEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "memory" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.MemoryEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@field title string Short title of the progress reporting. Shown in the UI to describe the long-running operation.
---@field requestId? integer The request ID that this progress report is related to. If specified, a debug adapter is expected to emit progress events for the long-running request until the request has been either *completed* or *cancelled*.<br>If the `requestId` is omitted, the progress report is assumed to be related to some general activity of the debug adapter.
---@field cancellable? boolean If `true`, the request that reports progress *may be cancelled* with a `cancel` request.<br>So, this property basically controls whether the client should use UX that supports cancellation.<br>Clients that **don't support cancellation** are allowed to ignore the setting.
---@field message? string More detailed progress message.
---@field percentage? number Progress percentage to display (value range: `0` to `100`). If omitted, no percentage is shown.

--- The event signals that a **long-running operation is about to start** and provides additional information for the client to set up a corresponding progress and cancellation UI.
--- The client is *free to delay* the showing of the UI in order to reduce flicker.
--- This event should **only** be sent if the corresponding capability `supportsProgressReporting` is `true`.
---@class dap.ProgressStartEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "progressStart" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.ProgressStartEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.ProgressUpdateEventBody
---@field progressId string The ID that was introduced in the initial `progressStart` event.
---@field message? string More detailed progress message. If omitted, the *previous message* (if any) is used.
---@field percentage? number Progress percentage to display (value range: `0` to `100`). If omitted, no percentage is shown.

--- The event signals that the progress reporting needs to be **updated** with a new message and/or percentage.
--- The client does **not have to** update the UI immediately, but the client **needs to keep track** of the message and/or percentage values.
--- This event should **only** be sent if the corresponding capability `supportsProgressReporting` is `true`.
---@class dap.ProgressUpdateEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "progressUpdate" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.ProgressUpdateEventBody # Event-specific information.

---@class dap.ProgressEndEventBody
---@field progressId string The ID that was introduced in the initial `dap.ProgressStartEvent`.
---@field message? string More detailed progress message. If omitted, the *previous message* (if any) is used.

--- The event signals the **end of the progress reporting** with a final message.
--- This event should **only** be sent if the corresponding capability `supportsProgressReporting` is `true`.
---@class dap.ProgressEndEvent : dap.Event
---@field event "progressEnd" # Type of event.
---@field body dap.ProgressEndEventBody # Event-specific information.

-- Reverse Requests (Adapter to Client)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Arguments for `runInTerminal` request.
---@class dap.RunInTerminalRequestArguments
---@field args string[] List of arguments. The first argument is the command to run.
---@field cwd string Working directory for the command. For non-empty, valid paths this typically results in execution of a change directory command.
---@field kind? dap.RunInTerminalKindEnum What kind of terminal to launch. Defaults to `integrated` if not specified.
---@field title? string Title of the terminal.
---@field env? table<string, string|nil> Environment key-value pairs that are added to or removed from the default environment.<br>A string is a proper value for an environment variable. The value `nil` removes the variable from the environment.
---@field argsCanBeInterpretedByShell? boolean This property should only be set if the corresponding capability `supportsArgsCanBeInterpretedByShell` is true. If the client uses an intermediary shell to launch the application, then the client must not attempt to escape characters with special meanings for the shell. The user is fully responsible for escaping as needed and that arguments using special characters may not be portable across shells.

--- This request is sent from the debug adapter to the client to run a command in a terminal.
--- This is typically used to launch the debuggee in a terminal provided by the client.
--- This request should only be called if the corresponding client capability `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` is true.
--- Client implementations of `runInTerminal` are free to run the command however they choose including issuing the command to a command line interpreter (aka 'shell'). Argument strings passed to the `runInTerminal` request must arrive verbatim in the command to be run. As a consequence, clients which use a shell are responsible for escaping any special shell characters in the argument strings to prevent them from being interpreted (and modified) by the shell.
--- Some users may wish to take advantage of shell processing in the argument strings. For clients which implement `runInTerminal` using an intermediary shell, the `argsCanBeInterpretedByShell` property can be set to true. In this case the client is requested not to escape any special shell characters in the argument strings.
--- (Title: Reverse Requests)
---@class dap.RunInTerminalRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "runInTerminal"

---@field request dap.StartDebuggingRequestEnum Indicates whether the new debug session should be started with a `launch` or `attach` request.
---@field [string] any # Allows additional properties

--- This request is sent from the debug adapter to the client to start a new debug session of the same type as the caller.
--- This request should only be sent if the corresponding client capability `supportsStartDebuggingRequest` is true.
--- A client implementation of `startDebugging` should start a new debug session (of the same type as the caller) in the same way that the caller's session was started. If the client supports hierarchical debug sessions, the newly created session can be treated as a child of the caller session.
---@class dap.StartDebuggingRequest : dap.Request
---@field command "startDebugging"
---@field arguments dap.StartDebuggingRequestArguments

--- Response to `startDebugging` request. This is just an acknowledgement, so no body field is required.

---@field moduleId? integer|string The module associated with this frame, if any.
---@field presentationHint? dap.StackFramePresentationHintEnum A hint for how to present this frame in the UI.<br>A value of `label` can be used to indicate that the frame is an artificial frame that is used as a visual label or separator. A value of `subtle` can be used to change the appearance of a frame in a 'subtle' way.

--- A `Scope` is a named container for variables. Optionally a scope can map to a source or a range within a source.

---@class dap.VariablePresentationHint
---@field kind? dap.VariablePresentationHintKindEnum The kind of variable. Before introducing additional values, try to use the listed values.
---@field attributes? dap.VariablePresentationHintAttributeEnum[] Set of attributes represented as an array of strings. Before introducing additional values, try to use the listed values.
---@field visibility? dap.VariablePresentationHintVisibilityEnum Visibility of variable. Before introducing additional values, try to use the listed values.
---@field lazy? boolean If true, clients can present the variable with a UI that supports a specific gesture to trigger its evaluation.<br>This mechanism can be used for properties that require executing code when retrieving their value and where the code execution can be expensive and/or produce side-effects. A typical example are properties based on a getter function.<br>Please note that in addition to the `lazy` flag, the variable's `variablesReference` is expected to refer to a variable that will provide the value through another `variable` request.

--- A Variable is a name/value pair.
--- The `type` attribute is shown if space permits or when hovering over the variable's name.
--- The `kind` attribute is used to render additional properties of the variable, e.g. different icons can be used to indicate that a variable is public or private.
--- If the value is structured (has children), a handle is provided to retrieve the children with the `variables` request.
--- If the number of named or indexed children is large, the numbers should be returned via the `namedVariables` and `indexedVariables` attributes.

This helps to identify the structured object in the collapsed state when its children are not yet visible.<br>An empty string can be used if no value should be shown in the UI.
---@field variablesReference integer If `variablesReference` is > 0, the variable is structured and its children can be retrieved by passing `variablesReference` to the `variables` request as long as execution remains suspended. See 'Lifetime of Object References' in the Overview section for details.

---@field indexedVariables? integer The number of indexed child variables.<br>The client can use this information to present the children in a paged UI and fetch them in chunks.
---@field memoryReference? string A memory reference associated with this variable.<br>For pointer type variables, this is generally a reference to the memory address contained in the pointer.<br>For executable data, this reference may later be used in a `disassemble` request.<br>This attribute may be returned by a debug adapter if corresponding capability `supportsMemoryReferences` is true.
---@field declarationLocationReference? integer A reference that allows the client to request the location where the variable is declared. This should be present only if the adapter is likely to be able to resolve the location.<br><br>This reference shares the same lifetime as the `variablesReference`. See 'Lifetime of Object References' in the Overview section for details.

For example, if the variable contains a function pointer, the adapter may be able to look up the function's location. This should be present only if the adapter is likely to be able to resolve the location.<br><br>This reference shares the same lifetime as the `variablesReference`. See 'Lifetime of Object References' in the Overview section for details.

---@field sortText? string A string that should be used when comparing this item with other items. If not returned or an empty string, the `label` is used instead.
---@field detail? string A human-readable string with additional information about this item, like type or symbol information.
---@field type? dap.CompletionItemType The item's type. Typically, the client uses this information to render the item in the UI with an icon.
---@field start? integer Start position (within the `text` attribute of the `completions` request) where the completion text is added. The position is measured in UTF-16 code units, and the client capability `columnsStartAt1` determines whether it is 0- or 1-based. If the start position is omitted, the text is added at the location specified by the `column` attribute of the `completions` request.
---@field length? integer Length determines how many characters are overwritten by the completion text, and it is measured in UTF-16 code units. If missing, the value `0` is assumed, which results in the completion text being inserted.
---@field selectionStart? integer Determines the start of the new selection *after* the text has been inserted (or replaced). `selectionStart` is measured in UTF-16 code units and **must be** in the range `0` and length of the completion text. If omitted, the selection starts at the end of the completion text.
---@field selectionLength? integer Determines the length of the new selection *after* the text has been inserted (or replaced), and it is measured in UTF-16 code units. The selection **cannot extend beyond** the bounds of the completion text. If omitted, the length is assumed to be `0`.

--- Provides formatting information for a value.
---@class dap.ValueFormat
---@field hex? boolean Display the value in hex.

--- Provides formatting information for a stack frame.
---@class dap.StackFrameFormat : dap.ValueFormat
---@field parameters? boolean Displays parameters for the stack frame.
---@field parameterTypes? boolean Displays the types of parameters for the stack frame.
---@field parameterNames? boolean Displays the names of parameters for the stack frame.
---@field parameterValues? boolean Displays the values of parameters for the stack frame.
---@field line? boolean Displays the line number of the stack frame.
---@field module? boolean Displays the module of the stack frame.
---@field includeAll? boolean Includes **all** stack frames, including those the debug adapter *might otherwise hide*.
